Manx
====

This is just a few customizations I've added to some of the Mac OSX
programmeer tools that I use. Right now this includes ctags, ack, and
vim.

You are welcome to use these as you see fit as I hereby license this
under the [Beerware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware#License) license.

### Where Does This Go?

$ ~ ==> $/Users/YourUsername/

### Why is This Called Manx?

Because Mac OSX releases are named after cats, and because my cat Jinx
is a Manx and she is the most loving wonderful cat in the world, even
if she doesn't have a tail.
